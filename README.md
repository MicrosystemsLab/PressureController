# PressureController
This repo contains source code for the Pressure Controller 2 for cell strain devices.
The project includes:
- A PCB design file for an Arduino-based electronic pressure controller
- Arduino firmware for the controller
- Client software for a PC to communicate with the controller

Use of this system was described in "An Easy-to-Fabricate Cell Stretching System Reveals Density-Dependent Mechanical Regulation of Collective Cell Movements in Epithelial Homeostasis", 2020.

Commercial versions of the Pressure Controller 2 system are available from Red Dog Research:
