# PressureController
Open-source code for the Pressure Controller for cell strain devices.
The project includes:
- A PCB design file for an Arduino-based electronic pressure controller
- Arduino firmware for the controller
- A SolidWorks CAD file for a mold for creating cell strain devices from PDMS
- Client software for a PC to communicate with the controller
